This attachment contains all the data of the article (sensitive information has been removed).
IBM SPSS 26.0 statistical software was used for data analysis. Count data are expressed as frequencies and percentages, and the Ï‡2 test was used for comparison between two groups. The sensitivity and specificity for qualitative results are calculated using a crosstab, while the sensitivity and specificity for quantitative results are calculated using logistic regression. The diagnostic efficacy of each diagnostic technique for CRC and APL was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Mann-Whitney tests or t-tests were used for comparisons of quantitative data. All tests were two-sided. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
